## Project-2-Presentation

<p>
      The objective was to build a website using the following technologies :
      HTML, CSS, React JS, and fetching data from an API.
</p>

<p>
      We had four weeks to do it. Two dedicated to the project conception using
      agile methods, and two weeks devoted to the development.
</p>

<p>
      We did a website about movies and decided to stand out by setting up a
      forum section where users and guests can discuss and chat together to find
      ideas or just about their passion.
</p>

<p>
      I invite you to check

<p>If you need to used the repository you have to do some command to install the project ! </p>

<p>First, you have to create a accompt on the API website. Here the link :  <a
        href="https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=fr"
        target="_blank"
        >https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=fr</a
      ></p>

<p>Then get the API key !</p>

<p>Clone the repository</p>

<p>Don't forget to do "npm install"</p>

<p>And do "npm run dev" to start the project.</p>

<p> Last command to configure everything, create a file .env based on the .env.sample</p>
